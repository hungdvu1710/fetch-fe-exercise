# fetch-fe-challenge

### Challenge Submission from Hung Vu. 
Run the app using the following command:

```
docker compose up --build
```

The app will be hosted on port 3000. \
Please manually add the .env.local file to the project in order to run. The content of this file I have included in the submission note.

I used Next.js (A React Framework) to complete this challenge. As it's highly compatible with Vercel Deployment. (And mostly because its ServerSide Rendering seems like fun)
